## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mini-mod adds 12 IWD and IWD2 items for purchase in Joluv's shop in Copper Coronet (See more detailed information on items in <a href="#components">Components section</a>).


<details><summary>Excerpt from Malek's mod introduction</summary>
<p></br>
When I started laying BG2 again few days ago I dug out this little modding attempt I did way back, and decided to release it rather than let it rot for all eternity on external HDD. It's pretty much what it says on the tin - a pack of 12 more IWD and IWD2 items for use in BG2

...


As far as I remember the items work as they should. They get added to Joluv's inventory - prices are a bit "ad hoc" since I had no guideline to follow.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with or without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. If you encounter any bugs, please report them on the forum!<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **setup-iwditempack.exe**, uninstall the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: iwditempack folder.</em>

<em>When installing or uninstalling, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

**Disable any antivirus** or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (<em>the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file</em>), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: iwditempack folder and a setup-iwditempack.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **setup-iwditempack.exe** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **setup-iwditempack.exe** in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Note for Complete Uninstallation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using **`setup-iwditempack --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
